# Dublin stream app - Plan your ride
Dublin stream app - plan your ride is a real-time analisys app of dublin bus sensors data and dublin traffic tweets from @DublinLive.

To find the bus line that will take you to your desired destination - visit "which line to take?"

To plan your ride please visit "Real time traffic analysis" where you can find:
 - Avg delayes of your choosen bus line on the time interval you want to investigate 
 - The temperature outside in the chosen time interval
 - A heat-map showing the congestion reports in the time interval, for the chosen line
 - A prediction - will you encounter an accident in the time range you filtered? a probability for an event to happen

## Requirements

### Twitter data
For running create_tweeter_data.py which creates the events_tweet file please install snscrape using: pip3 install snscrape

To save streaming data and the predictions on the stream data to Elastic serach use the warmup.ipynb notebook (also for the external data that can be uploaded from the web-app)

To run an H sample to solve the problem of the imbalance of our predicted label (event = car accident or roadblock) and to enhance the quality of the prediction using the bagging method please run _ notebook.
- An implementation of the suggested method in the article "An Effective Method for Imbalanced Time Series Classification: Hybrid Sampling"
